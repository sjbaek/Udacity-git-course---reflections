When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When collaborating with other people, or merging work progresses done on other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A:fork is to bring other people's repository to your repository with a possibility of updating the original documents through pull request. Clone is to copy to your repository. Branch is happening when you commit a new change to your master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A: Without Git, people would exchange files via emails or access the same file by saving it in a server location. No git would be intuitive and good for people who is not already familiar with Git. It is, however, harder if more and more people trying to update one or two files at the same time without a version control system such as Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A: Maybe when testing something different?
